Activity 1 - JavaScript typeOf
Objective:
To practice using and understanding JavaScript variables

Instructions:
In script.js file, create a list of at least 4-5 JavaScript variables with a short description of what each variable represents (e.g. "name" could represent a person's name, "age" could represent a person's age, etc.).
Next, create a series of console.log() statements that will print out each variable and its value to the console.
Once you have created the list of variables and the console.log() statements.
Once you have completed the scavenger hunt, you can try to edit the value of some variables and run the script again to see how the output changes.
Finally, try to create your own variables and add them to the list and see how it changes the output.

Activty 2 - Flip the variable

Instructions:
copy this code
let myArray = [5,'j',3,1,10,13,6,8,12];

and reverse the order of this array using a loop of your choice and a combination of any of the following, .push(),.pop(),.shift(),.unshift().
