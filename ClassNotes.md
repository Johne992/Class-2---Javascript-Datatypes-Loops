Null when the developer/human is saying nothing is there.
Undefined is when the computer is saying nothing is there. 

We have to subtract the value by 1 when counting down an array using its length because the index starts at 0 not 1. 

Everything in JavaScript is an Object.
A object is a complex datatype like an array. Now an object is different from an array in that 
it doesn't have a 0,1,2,3,4 index. It has key & value pairs. See Line 27. A key can be any datatype, make sure you put strings in quotations.
